# Mech103-projects
Here are all the programs from Mech 103 (Introduction to Mechanical Engineering)

1. **Lab 7**

Lab 7 worked with temperature sensors and Arduino Kits. I was able to get the readings from a temperature sensor and display it to the GUI. This allowed me to create a portable weather station.

2. **Lab 8**

see file comments for details. 

3. **Lab 9**

Lab 9 uses a sonar sensor usin a pwm pin. It calculates distance based on sonar sensor readings.

4. **Lab 10**

Lab 10 demonstrates button use through arduinos and breadboards.

5. **Loan Payment**

Loan payment calculates the loan payment based on monthly rate, intrest, amount paid, and principal balance.
